Hey there!
I'm Liam Hayes, a third-year Computer Science major with an Electrical Engineering minor at San Diego State University, expecting to graduate in December 2026.
I’m passionate about systems programming, hardware-software integration, and exploring new technologies.


Projects:
C++: Max Sum BST in Binary Tree (LeetCode #1373) 
  What it does: Finds the maximum sum of all keys of any subtree that is a Binary Search Tree (BST).
  Highlights: Demonstrates data structure manipulation (trees) and algorithmic complexity considerations.

Java: Maximum Performance of a Team (LeetCode #1383)
  What it does: Optimizes a selection of engineers for a team by balancing speed and efficiency under constraints.
  Highlights: Shows usage of sorting, priority queues, and dynamic optimization strategies.

MIPS: GCD, LCM, Random Sum
What it does:
  GCD/LCM: Demonstrates how to compute the Greatest Common Divisor and Least Common Multiple at the assembly level.
  Random Sum: Implements a random value generator and sums those values, showcasing basic arithmetic and loop structures in MIPS.
  Highlights: Great example of low-level problem-solving and understanding processor instruction sets.

LogicWorks: The “Gottcha Anti-Theft” Machine
  What it does: Simulates a digital logic circuit designed to detect and react to unauthorized access attempts.
  Highlights: Demonstrates knowledge of digital circuit design principles, combinational and sequential logic, and practical logic simulation.


Languages & Technologies:  
C++  
Java  
MIPS Assembly  
LogicWorks  
(Any other relevant languages/technologies, e.g., Python, C, JavaScript, etc.)


Interests / Focus:
